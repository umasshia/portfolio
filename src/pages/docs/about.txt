A little bit About who I am 
I’ve always had a knack for solving problems, like your doctor, your plumber, electrician,
mechanic and especially your accountant. They are all problem solvers at heart and, they are
some of the ones we most need to know, appreciate and celebrate. I want to join the ranks of
those problem solvers we celebrate for today’s fast paced, digital driven world because the
process of finding solutions is where I learn and grow the most and is why I have, and am,
pursuing a career in computer science. From computer languages to databases, from cloud
services to frameworks and everything in-between, my curiosity motivates and drives me to
always listen, learn and to be open to, not only new challenges, but also new people and
places as well. To find out more about me, like why a kid from Georgia (the country, not the
state), left home for college, got sent back home from college (Covid-19 pandemic), attended
classes online despite the 9 hour time difference has decided staying in the U.S. to live and
work is what I want to do with my life, give me a call, take a look at my website or connect
with me on LinkedIn and I will settle the curiousness I hope you have about myself and my
work.
